## Discrete Logarithm

In mathematics, a discrete logarithm is an integer k solving the equation b^k = g, where b and g are elements of a finite group. Discrete logarithms are thus the finite-group-theoretic analogue of ordinary logarithms, which solve the same equation for real numbers b and g, where b is the base of the logarithm and g is the value whose logarithm is being taken.
No efficient general method for computing discrete logarithms on conventional computers is known. Several important algorithms in public-key cryptography base their security on the assumption that the discrete logarithm problem over carefully chosen groups has no efficient solution.

## Abstract Binary Search

I create this function in year 2012, has many applications and including unorthodox methods to solve NP-complete problems, in this case, only I present as adaptation, to invert the discrete logarithm.

## Purpose

I think that the best teacher is the curiosity, so it not explain or giving a personal impression, not theorize nothing, only present the results.
